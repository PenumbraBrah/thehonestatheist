I don&#39;t have to know where the evidence is for why the deity doesn&#39;t exist—I think it is reasonable to assume it doesn&#39;t until proof is given. This is my rational, logical and skeptical approach to belief. I would wager this is also my reader&#39;s approach to every one of these gods listed: one does not give it a second thought. Of course they do not exist! How could you believe that they do?</p>
<p>This does, however, beg the question, &quot;why is the god you believe in different?&quot; Why have you believed in that deity, irrespective of all other deities? What makes your deity so special? Why is that deity exempt from the same level of skepticism as these others? How can you be sure yours is different from all other deities?</p>

<h2>Abundantia</h2><h3>Roman God of Abundance and Prosperity</h3><p>Abundantia was often portrayed in art, literature and even coinage as her association could be tied to fame, wealth, blessing and virtue. She was coupled with Roman emperors who desired to appear as bringing economic success to Rome. From her legends comes one explanation of the modern day &quot;cornucopia,&quot; a horn of abundance and feast. Legend says the cornucopia was given to Abundantia after it was ripped from the head of the river god Acheloüs defeated by hero Hercules.</p>
<p>Veneration of Abundatia would have peaked during Mithraism (a mysterious Roman cult dedicated to Mithras) and possibly continued into France during the Medieval era.</p>

<p>Admiration of this figurehead is now mostly symbolic, not actually belief in said deity. It is often tied to occult, Satanism, and devil worship.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The truth is, you know exactly what it is like to be an atheist with  respect to the beliefs of Muslims. Isn&#39;t it obvious that Muslims are  fooling themselves? Isn&#39;t it obvious that anyone who thinks that the  Koran is the perfect word of the creator of the universe has not read  the book critically? Isn&#39;t it obvious that the doctrine of Islam  represents a near perfect barrier to honest inquiry? Yes, these things  are obvious. Understand that the way you view Islam is precisely the way devout Muslims view Christianity. And it is the way I view all  religions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—from <em>Letter to a Christian Nation</em> by Sam Harris</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.</p>
