Not to disrespect this individual, but they seemed ignorant and a bit of a bigot on the issue, describing transsexuals as suffering from a &quot;mental disorder&quot; and staunchly believing there exists only two genders.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think it was their ignorance that surprised me. It was the nature of the attack and the dogmatism that alarmed me--and also the thought that I was like that once.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t say the conversation was particularly meaningful. I was not adequately armed with information to dispel the ignorance, so my main thrust was to say &quot;do some more research,&quot; which felt pathetic. Upon reflection, it would have been easier to find out the premise that this Christian was so precariously perched on: that Christians are uncomfortable with more than two genders because God said there was two.</p>
<p>And yet, Christians so often compromise when it comes to the Bible&#39;s standards and scientific evidence showing that a more humanistic approach is safer and more beneficial for all parties. Several historic issues that summarize this would include slavery, women&#39;s right to vote, and women&#39;s right to work. In all those cases, some Christians opposed the humanitarian side, but later on, Christians have switched the tune they sing.</p>
<p>So I should have asked questions like this, to get this person to think and realize why they believe what they do, and that such a belief is not necessarily grounded in reality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it okay for man/woman to exhibit womanly/manly traits?<ul>
<li>If not, you misunderstand the word &quot;trait.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is it okay for a man/woman to dress as the opposite gender?<ul>
<li>If not, where do you draw the line? Can men play women in Shakespearean plays? Can women wear jeans? Can girls buy/wear men&#39;s basketball shorts? Is it okay for men to wear makeup?</li>
<li>Obviously there are some gray areas...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is it okay for men/women to drag?<ul>
<li>Why not? Scripture does not necessarily condemn such a practice (please correct me if I&#39;m wrong, Christians. The only passages which could address this are in 1) Deuteronomy 22:5 regarding wearing the opposite gender&#39;s clothing, but this would mean jeans are out of the equation for women--and don&#39;t tell me that there are women jeans and that&#39;s why they can, because you are saying the only thing that separates men&#39;s clothing from women&#39;s clothing is a tag. The second passage would be in 2) 1 Corinthians 11:3-15, but it has to do with hairstyles, is an often debated passage, and often not lived out...)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do you deny that people who are born one gender cannot be mentally and emotionally distraught by that assignment?<ul>
<li>If so, we can&#39;t continue this conversation. You have not done the research.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How would you suggest addressing such a mental distress?<ul>
<li>Anything spiritual I will dismiss, keeping in mind that such a practice cannot apply to people who lack the spiritual belief. You can&#39;t expect someone to pray to god, if they don&#39;t believe he/she exists.</li>
<li>The idea that that person can be &quot;cured&quot; by helping them realign with their assigned gender at birth has been publicly proclaimed as ineffective.<a href="http://gaq.sagepub.com/content/41/2/182">1</a></li>
<li>The only remaining option I can think of is psychotherapy, helping the patient adjust, whether through hormones, biological procedures, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions would probably be enough food for thought for one day, even if it didn&#39;t spark enough conversation to last an entire day. Other questions I would ask a Christian might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does the church handle a transsexual who becomes a Christian? First Corinthians 7:17-24 suggests that those who are called should remain as they were when they are called. For a transsexual, this would mean a corrective surgery is unnecessary.</li>
<li>Do you realize there are many transsexuals already, many of whom you would not be able to tell the difference from the opposite gender?</li>
<li>Do you also realize that there are children at a young age that feel entirely out of place in their assigned gender?</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, best wishes if you engage in someone who thinks &quot;transgender&quot; is a mental disorder. To me, transgendered people are important and deserve some respect as well as support.</p></div><div class="mdl-color-text--grey-700 mdl-card__supporting-text"><button type="button" onclick="$('main').animate({ scrollTop: 0 }, 'fast');" class="mdl-button mdl-js-button mdl-button--accent mdl-js-ripple-effect centered-button">Back to Top</button></div></div><nav class="demo-nav mdl-color-text--grey-50 mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col"><a href="7" class="demo-nav__button"><button role="presentation" class="mdl-button mdl-js-button mdl-js-ripple-effect mdl-button--icon mdl-color--white mdl-color-text--grey-900"><i class="material-icons">arrow_back</i></button>Newer Post</a><div class="section-spacer"></div><a href="5" class="demo-nav__button">Older Post<button role="presentation" class="mdl-button mdl-js-button mdl-js-ripple-effect mdl-button--icon mdl-color--white mdl-color-text--grey-900"><i class="material-icons">arrow_forward</i></button></a></nav></div><footer style="background-color:white;margin-top:55px;" class="mdl-mega-footer"><div class="mdl-mega-footer__middle-section"><p>Published, maintained and edited by <a href="/about/honest.php">TheHonestAtheist</a>.
