<ul>
<li>A justified true belief that there is no god.</li>

<li><p><a href="index.php#contrapositive">contrapositive</a>{#contrapositive .define-term}</p>
<ul>
<li>In logic, it is the combination of both the inverse and converse, switching the subject and predicate of a sentence and negating both--such as:<ul>
<li>If I walk outside in the morning, then I whistle. &rarr; contrapositive is &rarr; If I am not whistling, then I am not walking outside in the morning.</li>
<li>All planes are vehicles. &rarr; contrapositive is &rarr; All non-vehicles are not planes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><a href="index.php#converse">converse</a>{#converse .define-term}</p>
<ul>
<li>In logic, it is the switching of the subject and predicate of a sentence to create a semi-negated structure, such as:<ul>
<li>If it is raining outside, then I am moody. &rarr; converse is &rarr; If I am moody, then it is raining outside.</li>
<li>All geckos are lizards. &rarr; converse is &rarr; All lizards are geckos.</li>
</ul>

<li><p><a href="index.php#criticalthinking">critical thinking</a>{#criticalthinking .define-term}</p>
<ul>
<li>Using logic, rationality, and some skepticism to question, process, and determine validity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><a href="index.php#faith">faith</a>{#faith .define-term}</p>
<ul>
<li>Belief in something without sufficient reason.<ul>
<li>If you had sufficient reason, it would no longer be called &quot;faith&quot;, but you&apos;d say &quot;I have reason to believe X.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><a href="index.php#inverse">inverse</a>{#inverse .define-term}</p>
<ul>
<li>In logic, it is the negating of the subject and predicate of a sentence to create a semi-negated structure, such as:<ul>
<li>The reason we can accept this definition, is because as soon as we have reasons or proof, we no longer use the word faith. We say, &quot;I have reason or evidence to think/believe...&quot;</li>
<li>All women who are doctors are smart. &rarr; inverse is &rarr; All women who are not doctors are not smart.</li>

<li><p><a href="index.php#nonestdeus">non est deus</a>{#nonestdeus .define-term}</p>
<ul>
<li>The Latin phrase &quot;non est deus&quot; literally means &quot;not is god&quot; or rearranged so it is actually meaningful in English, &quot;god is not.&quot; This phrase has been picked because it accurately describes the position an atheist holds--that an <a href="index.php#atheism">atheist</a> can justifiably claim &quot;There is no god.&quot; This is not the same as a logical claim that there are no gods. Such a position cannot be proven (one cannot prove things do not exist without omniscient knowledge). See post <a href="http://nonestdeus.com/posts/index.php?post=22">22</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><a href="index.php#posthocergopropterhoc">post hoc ergo propter hoc</a>{#posthocergopropterhoc .define-term}</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is the Latin phrase, &quot;after this, therefore because of this&quot; referring to the logical fallacy of assuming because thing B followed thing A, therefore thing A must have caused thing B. An example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My dog barks right before my neighbor pulls into my driveway. Therefore, my dog barking causes my neighbor to pull into my driveway.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Another more subtle example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The last three soccer games I won, and I drank an energy drink right before each of them. Therefore, drinking an energy drink before my next soccer game will allow me to win.</p>
</blockquote>

<li><p><a href="index.php#scientificmethod">scientific method</a>{#scientificmethod .define-term}</p>
<ul>
<li>Forming hypotheses that correlate to and explain phenomenon and make predictions based on those hypotheses; using experiment(s) to test and observe the outcome of such predictions; revising, expanding or rewriting hypotheses if the experiment(s) fails to confirm, or accepting it as a sound theory if the experiment(s) does confirm.</li>
