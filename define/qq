   * A justified true belief that there is no god.
"contrapositive": {"author": "contrapositive", "source": "",{#contrapositive .define-term}
   * In logic, it is the combination of both the inverse and converse, switching the subject and predicate of a sentence and negating both--such as:
      * If I walk outside in the morning, then I whistle. &rarr; contrapositive is &rarr; If I am not whistling, then I am not walking outside in the morning.
      * All planes are vehicles. &rarr; contrapositive is &rarr; All non-vehicles are not planes.
"converse": {"author": "converse", "source": "",{#converse .define-term}
   * In logic, it is the switching of the subject and predicate of a sentence to create a semi-negated structure, such as:
      * If it is raining outside, then I am moody. &rarr; converse is &rarr; If I am moody, then it is raining outside.
      * All geckos are lizards. &rarr; converse is &rarr; All lizards are geckos.

   * Using logic, rationality, and some skepticism to question, process, and determine validity.
"faith": {"author": "faith", "source": "",{#faith .define-term}
   * Belief in something without sufficient reason.
      * If you had sufficient reason, it would no longer be called &quot;faith&quot;, but you&apos;d say &quot;I have reason to believe X.&quot;
"inverse": {"author": "inverse", "source": "",{#inverse .define-term}
   * In logic, it is the negating of the subject and predicate of a sentence to create a semi-negated structure, such as:
      * The reason we can accept this definition, is because as soon as we have reasons or proof, we no longer use the word faith. We say, &quot;I have reason or evidence to think/believe...&quot;
      * All women who are doctors are smart. &rarr; inverse is &rarr; All women who are not doctors are not smart.

"atheism) can justifiably claim &quot;There is no god.&quot; This is not the same as a logical claim that there are no gods. Such a position cannot be proven (one cannot prove things do not exist without omniscient knowledge). See post [22](http://nonestdeus.com/posts/index.php?post=22": {   * The Latin phrase &quot;non est deus&quot; literally means &quot;not is god&quot; or rearranged so it is actually meaningful in English, &quot;god is not.&quot; This phrase has been picked because it accurately describes the position an atheist holds--that an [atheist].

   * This is the Latin phrase, &quot;after this, therefore because of this&quot; referring to the logical fallacy of assuming because thing B followed thing A, therefore thing A must have caused thing B. An example:
> My dog barks right before my neighbor pulls into my driveway. Therefore, my dog barking causes my neighbor to pull into my driveway.

   * Another more subtle example:
> The last three soccer games I won, and I drank an energy drink right before each of them. Therefore, drinking an energy drink before my next soccer game will allow me to win.

   * Forming hypotheses that correlate to and explain phenomenon and make predictions based on those hypotheses; using experiment(s) to test and observe the outcome of such predictions; revising, expanding or rewriting hypotheses if the experiment(s) fails to confirm, or accepting it as a sound theory if the experiment(s) does confirm.
